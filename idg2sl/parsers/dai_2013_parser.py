    Using a genome-wide siRNA library screening and biologic characterization, we identified that inhibition of
    thioredoxin reductase-1 (TXNRD1), one of the key antioxidant enzymes, with siRNAs or its inhibitor, auranofin,
    sensitized NSCLC cells to MK2206 treatment in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that the synthetic lethality
    interaction between the TXNRD1 and AKT pathways occurred through the KEAP1/NRF2 cellular antioxidant pathway.
    genome-wide siRNA screening was performed with the Dharmacon siRNA siGENOME library in the NSCLC cell line HCC193.
    Using a P value of 0.007542048 and at least 50% percent of growth inhibition as the cut-off, we identified 156 hits.
    Using cell proliferation assay and siRNA knockdown, we further validated the top 10 hits, including TXNRD1, CFLAR,
    ATP5J, SLC9A10, and CLN10. The results showed that knockdown of TXNRD1, CFLAR, SCLC9A10, AHCYL1, and CLN10 sensitized
    both HCC193 and H1993 cells to 1Î¼M MK2206
    For our purposes, we will take the top ten (validated) hits. Little information is presented about the remaining data
