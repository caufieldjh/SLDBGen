PIKFYVE	Phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) regulate cytoskeletal functions, membrane trafficking, and receptor signaling by recruiting protein complexes to cell- and endosomal-membranes. Humans have multiple PtdIns proteins that differ by the degree and position of phosphorylation of the inositol ring. This gene encodes an enzyme (PIKfyve; also known as phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase type III or PIPKIII) that phosphorylates the D-5 position in PtdIns and phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) to make PtdIns5P and PtdIns(3,5)biphosphate. The D-5 position also can be phosphorylated by type I PtdIns4P-5-kinases (PIP5Ks) that are encoded by distinct genes and preferentially phosphorylate D-4 phosphorylated PtdIns. In contrast, PIKfyve preferentially phosphorylates D-3 phosphorylated PtdIns. In addition to being a lipid kinase, PIKfyve also has protein kinase activity. PIKfyve regulates endomembrane homeostasis and plays a role in the biogenesis of endosome carrier vesicles from early endosomes. Mutations in this gene cause corneal fleck dystrophy (CFD); an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by numerous small white flecks present in all layers of the corneal stroma. Histologically, these flecks appear to be keratocytes distended with lipid and mucopolysaccharide filled intracytoplasmic vacuoles. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.[provided by RefSeq, May 2010]	19582903; 16954148	PTAR1

RAB2A	The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Rab family, members of which are small molecular weight guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) that contain highly conserved domains involved in GTP binding and hydrolysis. The Rabs are membrane-bound proteins, involved in vesicular fusion and trafficking. This protein is a resident of pre-Golgi intermediates, and is required for protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2011]	8910601	TSSC1
RAB6A	This gene encodes a member of the RAB family, which belongs to the small GTPase superfamily. GTPases of the RAB family bind to various effectors to regulate the targeting and fusion of transport carriers to acceptor compartments. This protein is located at the Golgi apparatus, which regulates trafficking in both a retrograde (from early endosomes and Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum) and an anterograde (from the Golgi to the plasma membrane) directions. Myosin II is an effector of this protein in these processes. This protein is also involved in assembly of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) by interacting with the cellular protein Bicaudal D1, which interacts with the HCMV virion tegument protein, pp150. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]	23091056	TSSC1
SEC23IP	This gene encodes a member of the phosphatidic acid preferring-phospholipase A1 family. The encoded protein is localized to endoplasmic reticulum exit sites and plays a critical role in ER-Golgi transport as part of the multimeric coat protein II complex. An orthologous gene in frogs is required for normal neural crest cell development, suggesting that this gene may play a role in Waardenburg syndrome neural crest defects. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2011]	20679433	PTAR1; RAB1A; TSSC1

SNAP23	Specificity of vesicular transport is regulated, in part, by the interaction of a vesicle-associated membrane protein termed synaptobrevin/VAMP with a target compartment membrane protein termed syntaxin. These proteins, together with SNAP25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa), form a complex which serves as a binding site for the general membrane fusion machinery. Synaptobrevin/VAMP and syntaxin are believed to be involved in vesicular transport in most, if not all cells, while SNAP25 is present almost exclusively in the brain, suggesting that a ubiquitously expressed homolog of SNAP25 exists to facilitate transport vesicle/target membrane fusion in other tissues. The protein encoded by this gene is structurally and functionally similar to SNAP25 and binds tightly to multiple syntaxins and synaptobrevins/VAMPs. It is an essential component of the high affinity receptor for the general membrane fusion machinery and is an important regulator of transport vesicle docking and fusion. Two alternative transcript variants encoding different protein isoforms have been described for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]	10036234	PTAR1
SPTLC1	This gene encodes a member of the class-II pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent aminotransferase family. The encoded protein is the long chain base subunit 1 of serine palmitoyltransferase. Serine palmitoyltransferase converts L-serine and palmitoyl-CoA to 3-oxosphinganine with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and is the key enzyme in sphingolipid biosynthesis. Mutations in this gene were identified in patients with hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1. Alternatively spliced variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.

Mutations in this gene were identified in patients with hereditary sensory neuropathy type I. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2011]	19416851; 10954427	PTAR1
SPTSSA	Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT; EC 2.3.1.50) catalyzes the first committed and rate-limiting step in sphingolipid biosynthesis. SSSPTA is a small SPT subunit that stimulates SPT activity and confers acyl-CoA preference to the SPT catalytic heterodimer of SPTLC1 (MIM 605712) and either SPTLC2 (MIM 605713) or SPTLC3 (MIM 611120) (Han et al., 2009 [PubMed 19416851]).[supplied by OMIM, Nov 2010]	19416851; 10954427	PTAR1

VAMP3	Synaptobrevins/VAMPs, syntaxins, and the 25-kD synaptosomal-associated protein are the main components of a protein complex involved in the docking and/or fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. This gene is a member of the vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)/synaptobrevin family. Because of its high homology to other known VAMPs, its broad tissue distribution, and its subcellular localization, the protein encoded by this gene was shown to be the human equivalent of the rodent cellubrevin. In platelets the protein resides on a compartment that is not mobilized to the plasma membrane on calcium or thrombin stimulation. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]	25002402; 11839770	PTAR1

The encoded protein is a component of a large multimeric complex, termed the retromer complex, involved in retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. The close structural similarity between the yeast and human proteins that make up this complex suggests a similarity in function. Expression studies in yeast and mammalian cells indicate that this protein interacts directly with VPS35, which serves as the core of the retromer complex. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]	9105038	TMEM165; TSSC1
